Celestial voyages : Explore the world beyond 

**Problem Statement:** In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers, but space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.

CELESTIAL VOYAGES : EXPLORE WORLDS BEYOND ?
HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
In the distant future, as space tourism becomes commonplace, the challenge is to develop a tool that serves as both a travel planner and educational resource. This tool will assist space travelers in crafting personalized itineraries for visiting celestial bodies like Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn within our solar system. Simultaneously, it aims to educate users about the diverse celestial objects present in our solar system, bridging the gap between present-day knowledge and future space exploration experiences. Key Components: Engagement: The webapp is designed to engage users interested in space tourism, offering a visually appealing and informative introduction. Exploration: By featuring specific destinations, it encourages users to explore and learn more about each destination, fostering interest in space exploration. Call to Action: The "Explore Destinations" and "Book Your Adventure" buttons serve as calls to action, guiding users to explore more or initiate contact. Why it's Important: Promotion: The webapp serves as a promotional tool for the fictional space tourism company, attracting potential space tourists and generating interest. Education: It educates users about potential space destinations and NASA's involvement in space exploration, combining entertainment with informative content. User Interaction: By incorporating buttons , it encourages user interaction and engagement, facilitating communication and potential bookings. This webapp concept lays the foundation for a larger website that could include more detailed information, interactive elements, and dynamic content to further enhance the user experience and promote space tourism. In future we would like to integrate with NLP, Hand tracking technology And Augmented Reality.
