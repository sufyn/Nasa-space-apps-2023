# Nasa-Space-Apps-2023: Celestial Voyages - Explore the World Beyond

## Problem Statement

In the distant future, space tourism will likely become a regular experience for Earth dwellers, but travelers will need help choosing their destinations and planning itineraries. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that not only generates customized itineraries for travelers wishing to visit planets like Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn, but also educates present-day users about the various objects in our solar system.
